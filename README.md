# 🕯️ The Cyber Grimoire

> *"The Grimoire opens only for those who seek."*

Welcome to the personal archive of **Alarakul** — a digital cultist, a student of systems, and a whisperer of logs.

This repository houses my cybersecurity journey through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), Linux fundamentals, and hands-on technical exploration. Each entry is a fragment carved from real-world challenges, lab trials, and unholy command-line rituals.

## 🔮 What This Is

A self-directed project built to:
- Document my cybersecurity learning journey
- Track technical growth from **Linux newbie** to **SOC-ready** and beyond
- Organize ritualistic practices into fragments for easy recall and future ritualization

You’ll find:
- Hands-on writeups
- Cheatsheets disguised as incantations
- The occasional error… documented with humility and flair

> *The logs never lie. But they do whisper.*
