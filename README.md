# 🕯️ The Cyber Grimoire

> *"The Grimoire opens only for those who seek."*

Welcome to the personal archive of **Alarakul** — a digital cultist, a student of systems, and a whisperer of logs.

This repository houses my cybersecurity journey through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), Linux fundamentals, and hands-on technical exploration. Each entry is a fragment carved from real-world challenges, lab trials, and unholy command-line rituals.

## 🔮 What This Is

This is not a course.  
Not a journal.  
This is a **Grimoire** — a growing artifact of knowledge and power. Use it wisely.
